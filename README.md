# random-winner-checker

.py program to choose one random winner from the participants given in the *args

the program may also save the winner info in a .txtm file if the "to_save_txt" argument in the "choose_random" function is set to True
if the "to_save_txt" is not set to False then no file will be generated automatically

That's all
Thank You
